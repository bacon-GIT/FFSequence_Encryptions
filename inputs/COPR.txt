In whatever way and through whatever means a  
cognition may relate to  objects, that through which it relates immediately  to  them, and at which all thought as a means is directed as an 
end, is intuition. This, however, takes place only insofar as the object is given to us; but this in turn, is possible only if it affectsC the mind in a certain way. 
The capacÂ­ity  (receptivity) to  acquire representations through  the way in  which we  are affected by  objects is  called sensibility.  Objects are therefore given to  us  by  means of sensibility,  and it alone affords us intuitions; but they are thought through the understanding, and from it  arise concepts. 
But all thought,  whether straightaway (directe) or through a detour (indirecte), must ultimately be related to intuitions, thus, in our case, to  sensibility,  since there is no  other way in which objects can be given to us.
